<!--This section will start with three images at the top in replacement for another major heading , adding in another main h1 title didn't seem 
appropriate because this page is a continuation of my first page versus a brand new topic, story continuing vs new chapter -->
<!-- again separated into a div class so that all the elements were in the same object and it made the aligning of pictures and text a simpler task -->
<!--source for creating the div class to organize the picutres and the text via W3 schools -->

<!-- the only paragraph with a different class because there needed to be a wider spread of the text as there aren't any pictures floating to the side 
it was necessary to set new css property/value pairs here -->
    <p class = txtd>  
        Here I have included some pictures of Trinidad and Tobago the country where my parents are from 
        and where I spent time growing up. Although I still spent a large amount of my time in Canada, I think 
        that my time here and the influence that my family, who did grow up there, had on me nurtured by love of nature. 
        I got to spend time and have my worldview shaped by a lot of people who placed a value on conservation.

<!-- This section does not include pictures so including it in this div class was less of a design choice and more so that the code read as being a block, this sections 
is thematically related more than design related -->
    <h2 class = titles> CURRENTLY </h2>

    <p class= txtc> I am curently a student at Fleming College in the GIS applications specialist program. Hoping to find new ways 
        to continue learning what I love and find new applications for the thing I've learned during my time in school.
