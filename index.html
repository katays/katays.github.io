        Resume 2.0: The expected outcome of this undertaking is to produce a resume
        that is hopefully more interesting than what one would normally recieve. I chose to focus on my education 
        and the life experiences and interests that lead me down the path I took. Also why I hope to go in the 
        future.

    I completed my undergraduate degree as a double major in <a href = "https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/undergraduate/programs/" target="_blank">Biodiversity & Conservation Biology</a> going to go and then I can fill it in at another time. 
     and <a href = "https://www.environment.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/programs-study/bsc-ba-programs" target="_blank">Environmental Studies</a>. Although these two majors fall into different areas of study, science
     and humanities respectively, there was a lot of overlap between core concepts. I think that taking them concurrently was a valuable experience in recognizing the ways that they rely on each other. The overlap 
     made the learning process easier as it felt like a more holistic experience. This also allowed me view what I was learning in a way that was more applicable to the real world. 
     Overall it was a challeging but great experience.

    One of my favourite, and largest, projects I had the opportunity to complete during my time in school was a complete environmental assessment for Evergreen Brickworks. 
    The focus of the assessment was reducing the amount of garbage waste that was produced during their weekend farmers market and other events on site. The solutions we created 
    were directed at reducing the amount of waste created in two main ways. First from the vendors and the type of packaging there were distributing premade products in, and 
    secondly in the form of labelling and access to recycling, foodwaste and garbage recepticles on sight. It involved primary research in the form of interviewing vendors and patrons. 
    It was my first time taking on a project like this and happened in the last year of my studies so it was a nice way to use the skills I had learned and tie everything together.
